# Order-Request

# Goal of this project

### The intent of this project is to provide an app that is used for orders. Let's walk through a use case:

    - You create an account, and log in.
    - You join a group. Now you are able to create trips that other people can add themselves to.
    - Let's say you add a trip to Walmart; I need something from Walmart and don't feel like going out, so I can add myself to the trip, designating what I want. On your side, when you create the order, you specify what payment you would prefer, be it cash, Vennmo, or other.

    - The idea is to make it easier to make lists, and avoid paper lists and short-term memory.
